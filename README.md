# GoParkYourself
*A mobile application developed for the SC2006 Software Engineering module in NTU, which displays live motorized and bicycle parking data across Singapore.*

## Overview
Due to our client-server architecture, this application is mainly separated into two parts: the Frontend and Backend.

The Frontend (`frontend/`) is developed using React Native, React Native Paper for the UI, and Zustand for global state management.

The Backend (`backend/`) is developed using Node.js with Express framework, MySQL database for storing parking information and performing queries, and Docker for easier deployment in our remote AWS EC2 server.
